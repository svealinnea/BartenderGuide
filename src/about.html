        <p>The Bartender's Guide has already supplanted the great <em>Codex Bartactica</em> as the standard repository of all bar/pub/saloon/watering-hole knowledge and wisdom, for though it has many omissions, it scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two important respects: First, it is cheaper; and secondly it has the words CALM DOWN inscribed in large friendly letters on its cover.</p>
        <p>The Bartender's Guide to the Galaxy is an indispensable companion to all those who are keen to make sense of bar life in an infinitely complex and confusing multi-bar-verse. Where it is inaccurate it is at least definitely inaccurate. In cases of major discrepancy it's always reality that's got it wrong.</p>
        <p>"The Guide is definitive. Reality is often inaccurate."</p>
